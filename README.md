# russian-vocab-spelling-practice
A client-side web app study aide for my Russian course. The app asks for the Russian translation of English words/expressions. The vocabularies are partitioned by the units/chapters of our course textbook, *Road to Russia: Russian Language Textbook For Beginners, North American Edition*.

Made with React.js and Bootstrap.
